# Farmer-Merchant integration 

 This project deals with developing Cold Storage Web based application. It provides the interaction between the farmer and cold storage and also between cold storage and merchant. The system is implemented using a 3-tier approach, with a backend database, a middle tier of Java with JSP, and a web browser as the front-end client.
## 🚀 About Project
In order to develop a Cold Storage Web based application, a number of Technologies must be studied and understood. These include multi-tiered architecture, server and client-side scripting techniques, implementation technologies such as Java with JSP, programming language (Java & JavaScript etc.) and relational databases (MySql).
This project provides common platform for the farmers and merchants on business level.  This Farmer and Merchant integration or FM Integration will act as a mediator between two parties i.e.  Farmers and Merchants. FM Integration is being used for procurement of many food products in an effective and efficient way.

## 🏆Features

##### This project is providing a very good platform for farmers and merchants. Farmers will use the system by storing their materials in cold storage through allotted katte. Merchants will borrow the products from cold storage. There are various attractive features of FM Integration like: -          

- Provides good accessibility of database
- Maintain the consistency of the data.
- Reduce the overhead from the database handler which presently depends on the manual work.
- Provide the good portability feature that means anyone can access this system from anywhere at any time on the basis of their need.


## 👉PROPOSED SYSTEM
- Fully Automated System is used.
- Centralized database with no redundancy i.e. proper normalization.
- Common platform for farmers and merchants.
- Both parties will be benefited.


## 🤘🏻OBJECTIVE

#### The client’s requirement in the portal was to broadly categorize users in the web application. The three categories are:  

- Farmer
- Merchant
- Owner
